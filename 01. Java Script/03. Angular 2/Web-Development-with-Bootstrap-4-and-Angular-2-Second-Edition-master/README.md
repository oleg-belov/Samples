## About the Book

Two of the most popular front-end frameworks, Angular and Bootstrap, have undergone a major overhaul to embrace emerging web technologies so that developers can build cutting-edge web applications. You can build high-quality single page apps with elegant user interfaces by combining the power of both these tools.

Inside this title you’ll dive, fingers first, into the basics of both the tools, and once you’re familiar with them, you’ll get your hands dirty by working with Bootstrap’s new Grid system and Angular’s built-in directives. You’ll then learn how to format output using Angular’s Pipes and how to make use of the built-in router to set up routes for all your components.

Webpack will be your buddy to wrap up your project. Then after throwing in some SASS to make things pretty, you’ll learn to validate the forms you’ve built and debug your application. Finally, you’ll go on to learn how to obtain smooth transitioning from Bootstrap to Angular and then how to hook up with a server and use Firebase as the persistence layer.

Once you’re done with this book, you’ll not only have a lovely little e-commerce application running, but you’ll also take with you the confidence to innovate and build your own applications with ease.

## Who this book is for?

Whether you know a little about Bootstrap or Angular or you're a complete beginner, this book will enhance your capabilities in both frameworks and help you build a fully functional web app. A working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is required to fully get to grips with Bootstrap and Angular.
